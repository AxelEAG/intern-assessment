Please answer the following questions.

1. What is your name?
    Axel Emmanuel Almaguer Gaona

2. How long did you work on this project?
    ~2 hours

3. What is the most challenging part of the project?
    It was the first time I was trying to use CRUD so I had to watch some tutorials and learn about the process. However, after understanding it, the rest went pretty smoothly.

4. What did you learn from this project?
    I learnt about how to do CRUD, collect json responses, utilize postman, and the usefullness of keeping your code well organized and clean.

5. What would you like to add or improve in this project?
    I added an unmark option as I felt it was one of the basic things to make it complete within its internal logic. Otherwise I believe it was a good way to test all of the basics and further complexities would only add time spent, but no real extra understanding of the topic. Still, maybe testing a bit more the design aspect or UX could be usefull.

6. What is your feedback on this project?
    Overall good, I liked working on it and felt like I learned some very useful applications. 

7. What is your suggestion for this project?
    Asides from the aforementioned, maybe a bit more clarity or more specific instructions could help. I wasn't sure if there was an expectation of allowing the users to perform CRUD through the website or only through postman. I also was a bit confused about having to need to modify app.js to add a direct route of tasks to avoid seeing the initial "Cannot GET /" screen.
